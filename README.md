# HK-Twitter-Data-Mining-
This repo houses the codes and methodology we used to mine tweets data, using a web-scraping script we modified but was originally written for this purpose by [Jefferson Herique](https://github.com/Jefferson-Henrique/GetOldTweets-python). The modified version of the package that works on command line interface across all OS's can be found in this repo [here](https://github.com/marquisvictor/Modified-GetOldTweets3). 


#### This repo houses the codes, datasets generated, and visualisations we used in this project.
